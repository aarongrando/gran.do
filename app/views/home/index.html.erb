<h1>Hi. I’m <strong>Aaron Grando</strong>, a web developer and designer in Brooklyn.</h1>
<p>
	I live with my girlfriend, two cats, and about a dozen plants. The cats and I are natives of Philadelphia.
	Everyone else came from New York, as best as I can tell. I miss hoagies.
</p>
<p>
	I’m interested in technology as entertainment, the new aesthetic, and reducing the burden that over-anxious technology
	has placed on our lives.
</p>
<p>
	By day, I assume the role of Tech Lead at <%= link_to "RTO+P", "http://rtop.com" %>. That means I help strategize, build, and maintain the dev team, and
	the apps built by the team.
</p>
<p>
	In 2012, I created <%= link_to "What Say Co.", 'http://whatsay.co/' %> and a line of @Horse_ebooks-inspired tee-shirts. In 2014 I was quoted in the 
	<%= link_to "<em>New Yorker</em>".html_safe, "http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2014/02/10/140210fa_fact_orlean"%>
	saying something about <%= link_to "long cons", "http://instagram.com/p/kACFsYB1bn/" %>.
