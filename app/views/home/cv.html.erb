	<h2>Purpose</h2>
	<p>
		I have been lucky enough to build software that has helped inspire and improve the lives of many people. I want 
		to keep doing so, surrounded with the best company possible. For me, right now, that means working with a team that has the talent, 
		resources, and (sometimes foolhardy) determination to build grand ideas that keep humans in mind.

	<h2>School</h2>
	<p>
		In 2005, I entered Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. In 2009, I graduated with a B.S. in Digital Media. I studied with a focus on web design and
		development. I led my Senior Project team, which produced a social network for sharing and collaborating on choose-your-own-adventure stories called "Derivativ".
	</p>
	
	<h2>Play</h2>
	<p>
		In 2012, I co-founded What Say Co. and designed a line of Horse_ebooks-inspired tees. We sold enough to break even and have a lot of fun in the meantime.
	</p>
	<p>
		This year, I have been building Crews, a short-message chat service for small teams. Crews is inspired by my own move away from the RTO+P dev team in Philadelphia.

	<h2>Skills</h2>
	<p>
		As a developer, I'm well-rounded: Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I like Ruby on Rails, and use it as my primary application development tool.
		I'm a firm believer in web standards. I use SASS. I go easy on the jQuery. I am very comfortable on a command line.
	</p>

		personal design work.
	</p>

		As a coworker, I'm friendly, open and honest. I don't mind talking to clients or taking meetings. I enjoy teaching. I'm always in
		search of a greater efficiency.
